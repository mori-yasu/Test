画像を扱うためのクラス作成(vec3))

Chapter 2: The vec3 class
Almost all graphics programs have some class(es) for storing geometric vectors and colors. In
many systems these vectors are 4D (3D plus a homogeneous coordinate for geometry, and
RGB plus an alpha transparency channel for colors). For our purposes, three coordinates
suffices. We’ll use the same class vec3 for colors, locations, directions, offsets, whatever. Some
people don’t like this because it doesn’t prevent you from doing something silly, like adding a
color to a location. They have a good point, but we’re going to always take the “less code” route
when not obviously wrong.
Here’s the top part of my vec3 class:

I use floats here, but in some ray tracers I have used doubles. Neither is correct-- follow your
own tastes. Everything is in the header file, and later on in the file are lots of vector operations:

Now we can change our main to use this:
